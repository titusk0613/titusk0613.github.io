        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Hazards in Cassie’s life have required her to do more work on the farm during the day, changing her life and the way she lives. Changes in her life are clearly due to the white people, her parents and friends, and finally their money crisis.

                Although Cassie changed a lot one of the major changes that she went through is that she was required to do more work on the farms because of many reasons. One of the reasons that she was required to work on the farms is because of their money crisis. In the novel, her family went through a huge money crisis. They could have avoided this issue by selling their and but they cared very much about their land because Cassie’s grandfather had bought this land. It was a special place to them and as it says in the book “Look at all of the lands we have and it’s all yours [...].”

                Finally, she changes in a way where she lives differently. The main cause of this is the white people that are threatening her and her family. This makes her worried and scared all the time. Another reason why she is living differently or more worriedly is because of her parents and friends. An example of this is when T.J. is mean to her and this makes her afraid of him. Her parents also change her as well. Her parents change her because they are afraid that she will get hurt.

                Ultimately, this essay has shown that  Cassie has gone through many changes, such as being on the farm more often, which has made her more independent.
