        <h2>Book Review and Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Hello everyone! My name is Titus Kim and today I will be reviewing the book “Lord of the Flies” by William Golding. This book is a modern classic and was published in 1954. This was Golding's first novel that he had published.

The basic plot of this book starts when a British plane crashes. The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood. Two boys named Ralph and an overweight, boy nicknamed "Piggy"—find a conch, which Ralph uses as a horn to gather all the survivors to one area. Ralph is optimistic, believing that grown-ups will come to rescue them. Because Ralph appears responsible for bringing all the survivors together, he immediately commands some authority over the other boys and is quickly elected their "chief". Ralph then establishes three primary policies: to have fun, to survive, and to constantly maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships, However, the order and democracy in their group quickly deteriorate as the majority of the boys turn idle and instead develop common paranoia. The paranoia refers to a supposed monster they call the "beast” which lives on their island. An unexpected twist supposedly makes them turn against each other. 

The author William Golding shows vividly how boys act. He shows and deals with a fundamental issue of humanity, Are people naturally prone to evil? This book makes you ponder about what you would do in these situations and shows what humans can do to each other.

I recommend this book to ages 14 and above as there is a lot of violence, blood, and cursing.

Overall, this book is an amazing read and I definitely recommend this book to you.

Again my name is Titus Kim and thank you for listening.
