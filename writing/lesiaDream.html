        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Titus Kim
            From not having enough food to having little to no clean clothes Lesia had trouble getting to Canada. Even when she arrived she had difficulties. My mom, on the other hand, had a lot easier time adjusting and arriving in Canada. 
            
            To begin with, Lesia started off poor. By saving up the little money she earned she and her family were able to immigrate to Canada. Desperately making it to Canada on a rough boat trip Lesia wasn’t treated very well. Everyone around her called her immoral and shameful names. She was exhausted, starving, and was messy. 
            
            My mom, on the other hand, had a completely different experience. My mom’s parents sent her here so that she could have a better education in the university. Lesia had her family as motivation but my mom came alone and stayed with someone else. She was well fed unlike Lesia but was lonely at times. One could say they were the complete opposites. My mom had everything she needed but a family while Lesia had nothing except family. My mom also had clothes, money and entertainment as well.
            
            Lesia and my mom have very different immigration but they have similarities as well. My mom had trouble adjusting as everywhere was new. Lesia had a similar experience as my mom as she had trouble adjusting to both the language and people. She had difficulty farming as the ground was too hard while my mom had trouble studying as she had difficulties with English.
            
            Now about after a year Lesia is more comfortable and has figured almost everything out. My mom also was able to figure everything out and learn most of the English she needed to know. Then after two years, Lesia was part of the community and my mom had figured out and learned English. 
            
            In conclusion, both Lesia and my mom have differences and similarities. They both had trouble adjusting but in the end, they both figured it out. They also had differences.  My mom had food, clothes, and a clean place to live but Lesia had none of those. That is the contrast between Lesia and my mom’s immigration.
