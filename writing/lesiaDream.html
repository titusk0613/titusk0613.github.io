        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
From not having enough food to having little to no clean clothes, Lesia had trouble getting to Canada. Even when she arrived she had difficulties. My mom, on the other hand, had a much easier time adjusting and arriving in Canada. Both Lesia and my mom have differences and similarities. They both had trouble adjusting but in the end, they both figured it out. They also had differences.  My mom had food, clothes, a clean place, and started off at a higher position than Lesia but Lesia had none of those.
To begin with, my mom had a good supply of food as well as enough clean clothes. Lesia, on the other hand, is going days without food at times. She also has dirty, tattered clothing which affects the way people look at her. This makes it hard to make money and earn the trust of the community. Lesia spends most of the day trying to farm so that she has enough money to eat. She has no food but a loving family. My mom has food so that she has the freedom to do whatever she wanted but had no family to support her in Canada. 
Secondly, my mom had a clean place to stay. Lesia did have a place to stay but it wasn’t as nice as she wanted it to be. With a place to stay and the freedom with money to some extent, my mom was able to study and do whatever she wanted to do. Lesia had so many things to do. Build her house, get clean clothes, cultivate the land. The list goes on! 
Finally, my mom started off at a higher position than Lesia. Lesia had to save her money and work her way up while my mom was supported financially by her parents. Desperately making it to Canada on a rough boat trip, Lesia wasn’t treated very well. This was mainly due to the fact that Canada and Ukraine(Austria) were at war. Asians would also have been treated badly but my mom was in a time where Canada was very diverse.
All of these differences show how unfair it would be if you were Lesia. However, there are some similarities as well. They both had trouble with language. My mom had trouble adjusting as everywhere was new. Lesia had a similar experience as my mom because she had trouble adjusting to both the language and people. After about a year, Lesia is more comfortable and has figured almost everything out. My mom was also able to figure everything out and learn most of the English she needed to know. Then, after two years, Lesia was part of the community and my mom had figured out and learned English.
In conclusion, both Lesia and my mom have differences and similarities. They both had trouble adjusting but in the end, they both figured it out. My mom had food, clothes, and a clean place to live but Lesia had none of those. That is the contrast between Lesia and my mom’s immigration.
