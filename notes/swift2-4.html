            Classes and Inheritence

        <h5>
            In Inheritence there is a base class, a subclass, and a superclass. A parent class is called a superclass,
            and a child class is called a subclass. Superclass is is known as a baseclass. Here is an example of a
            superclass and subclass being used:

        <h5>In this example, the movie is a subclass and the media is a superclass. In this example movie inherits all
            of the methods and properties of media.</h5>
        <h5>To override a characteristic that would otherwise be inherited, like writing a new implementation for a
            function, you prefix your new definition with the override keyword. Similar to this to acess a property from a superclass we have to use super.</h5>
            <h5>Different from structures classes use refrences. This means that each line is very closely linked</h5>
