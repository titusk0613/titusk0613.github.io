        <h2>Guard</h2>
        <h5>Guard allows your code to be more straight forward thus making it easier to find potential bugs.</h5>

        <h5>if statements are great for when you only need to find out one thing. If you need multiple it starts to get
            very complicated. Why? This is because as you add more and more if statements the code gets further away
            from the beggining making it harder to read.</h5>

        <h5>So rather than doing that we can use a guard statement to move the code out of any braces. This is it in
            simplest terms:</h5>

        <h5>The above example is actually the complete opposite.</h5>

        <h5>In addition to this guard functions require you to exit the scope of the function so that it can reach the
            end. To do this we use a return statement at the end of the else.</h5>

        <h2>Guard with optionals</h2>

        <h5>In previous lessons we learned about optionals where we use if-let to unwrap. However with guard we use
            guard-let and use it similar to the opposite of if-let. Here is an example of a guard with optional:</h5>
