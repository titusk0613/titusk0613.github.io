        <h5>Optionals are unique syntaxes that are used when there is no data</h5>
        <h2>nil</h2>
        <h5>nil represents the absence of value or nothing</h5>
        <h2>Specifying the optional</h2>
        <h5>For most cases you have to specify what type it is. In most cases you have to use type annotation. Here is
            an example of the above two being used:</h5>

        <h5>To determine whether a optional contains a value or not we can use you start with an if statement and a
            nil. If it isn't a nil than you can use the force-unwrap operator, !</h5>

        <h5>This can sometimes be redundant and so we can also use optional binding, if it contains a value, assigns
            the value to a constant as a non-optional type, making it safe to work with.</h5>

        <h5>Any initializer that might return nil is called a failable initializer</h5>
