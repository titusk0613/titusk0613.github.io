Collections
        </h2>
        <h5>
The most common type of collection is an array. This is what it looks like: 
        </h5>

        <h5>We can specify if the array is Int but we also don't have to because Swift will be able to infer</h5>
        <h5>We can also use contains(_:) method to pass a value and determine if it is true or not.</h5>

        <h2>Working with Arrays</h2>
        <h5>Repeating: var myArray = [Int](repeating: 0, count: 100)
        </h5>
        <h5>This allows repeated default initializers</h5>
        <h5>Acessing a specific term: to do this we use a [] with a number inside. If we had a list than the first one is 0 For example:</h5>
        <img src = "../Screenshots for App Development/Screen Shot 2020-01-31 at 10.36.00 PM.png">
        <h5>This would print 1</h5>
        <h5>insert(_: at:) is a method we can use to add a term in a certain place<br>
            remove(at:) is a method to get rid of a term in a place<br>
            removeLast() gets rid of the last term<br>
            removeAll() gets rid of everything
            <br>
            Along with this you can add arrays
        </h5>
        <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
        <h5>Here is an example:</h5>

        <h5>Using updateValue(_:, forKey:) you can modify a dictionary</h5>
