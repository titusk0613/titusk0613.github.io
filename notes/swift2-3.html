        <h2>Structures</h2>
        <h5>In its simplest form, a structure is a named group of one or more properties that make up a type. Custom
            Type.</h5>
        <h4>
            Things you need to remember:
        </h4>
        <ol>Capitalize type names</ol>
        <ol>Use lowercase for property names</ol>
        <h4>In Structures there are methods</h4>
        <h4>A method is a function that's assigned to a specific type.</h4>
        <h4>To use these types however we use instances.(initialization)</h4>
        <h4>When to objects are the same we can use instances for different parts. Or because we need values for more
            than 1 things. For example:</h4>

        <h4>We can add functions in the structs as well.</h4>
        <h4>Initializers are functions that return return a new instance. The default Initializers is "init()". Strings
            are "" Ints are 0 and boolean is false.</h4>
        <h4>Memberwise Initializers are instances with a not default value. They look like this but we change the
            value:</h4>

       <h4>Methods are functions in structures</h4>
        <h4>Custom initializers</h4>
        <h4>You can customize initializers by defining your own initializers. Rather than setting it to a certain value
            you would set it to a type. Here is an example of this:</h4>

        <h4>Instance and Mutating Methods</h4>
        <h4>Instance methods are functions that can be called on specific instances of a type. Mutating methods are
            used to update the property values of a structure within an instance method.</h4>
