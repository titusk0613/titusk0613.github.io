        <h4>David Hawksworth</h4>
        <p class="transparent">Chef David Hawksworth realized his culinary vision at his first eponymous restaurant, in
            the very heart of
            downtown Vancouver. At Hawksworth Restaurant, which opened in 2011, he has created the ideal setting to
            deliver compelling contemporary Canadian cuisine; a demonstration of his European-trained technical
            ability, deep appreciation for local ingredients and an absolute insistence on only the very best quality.
            Winner of 2012 and 2013 Vancouver Magazine Restaurant Awards Restaurant of the Year and Chef of the Year
            and for four consecutive years, Best Upscale Dining, as well as enRoute magazine’s top three Best New
            Restaurants, and Maclean’s magazine Restaurant of the Year; Hawksworth has anchored himself at the helm of
            the Vancouver – and Canadian – dining scene.

            such as Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons, L’Escargot and The Square, David Hawksworth soon emerged as one of

            inductee in to the BC Restaurant Hall of Fame.

            international stage to boost the career of a young professional chef; Hawksworth is joined by notable guest
            chef judges from across the country to determine the winner who compete in a culinary cook off, firmly
            cementing Hawksworth’s culinary influence on the international stage. This year the program is expanding
            across Canada by hosting regional heats in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal; top finalists then
            travel to Vancouver to vie for the title of Hawksworth Scholar.

            Chef Hawksworth began a culinary partnership with Air Canada in fall 2015 and now designs signature dishes
            that are now exclusively featured on Air Canada flights in International Business Class and in Maple Leaf
